# Project instructions

## Ownership
Dirthara owns this package. Attribute copyright, licensing, and authorship to `Dirthara` rather than to an individual
maintainer. The MIT `LICENSE` reads `Copyright (c) <year> Dirthara`, and new files or documents that name an owner use
the same name.

## Branching
Every supported version has its own branch; there is no `main`. Target a feature at the newest release branch and a fix
at the earliest supported branch that has the bug, then forward-merge upward. Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)
before branching, merging, or releasing.

## Committing
Never run `git commit`, `git push`, `git tag`, or anything else that writes to history or to the remote. Stage nothing
and commit nothing: the maintainer commits and pushes every change themselves. Leave the work in the working tree and
say what is ready.

## Tests
Line coverage of `src` must stay at 100%; `composer coverage` fails below it and lists the uncovered lines. Add tests in
`tests` with every implementation change. The empty scaffold explicitly skips tests and coverage until PHP files exist
in `src` or `tests`; after that, the full checks are required.

## Development
Use the PHP container for Composer and PHP commands; see [README.md](README.md). Use the `Dirthara\Http` namespace for
source and `Dirthara\Http\Tests` for tests. Declare strict types in every PHP file.

## Exceptions
Read and follow [exception conventions](agents/exceptions.md) when creating or modifying exceptions.

## Documentation
Read and follow [documentation conventions](agents/documentation.md) when writing the README or anything in `docs`.

## Packaging
Read and follow [packaging conventions](agents/packaging.md) when changing what a release contains, the actions the CI
workflow uses, or the dependency update configuration.
